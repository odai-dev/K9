📌 Ultra-Professional Prompt for Replit AI

Instruction:
You are modifying the existing K9 System project. Follow these instructions precisely and implement them with clean, maintainable, and secure code. Do not skip any detail.

1. Target Sections

Training Section

Veterinary Section

Both sections already exist in the system and are accessible through the main navigation.

2. Feature to Implement

Add a new navigation button labeled “Reports” inside each of the above sections.

This button must appear consistently in the UI (respect the current styling and layout).

When pressed, the button should navigate the user to the General Reports Section.

3. Behavior and Routing Logic

When in Training Section → Reports button clicked → Navigate to General Reports page → Apply filter = “Training Reports”.

When in Veterinary Section → Reports button clicked → Navigate to General Reports page → Apply filter = “Veterinary Reports”.

The navigation should not just open General Reports blindly; it must preload and filter reports for the originating section.

Filtering should use existing report models, or if absent, create a query parameter such as:

/reports?type=training

/reports?type=veterinary

4. UI/UX Requirements

Button style:

Match the system’s current button theme (rounded, consistent color scheme).

Place button in the top-right corner of each section panel header (or consistent location in section layout).

Ensure RTL (Right-To-Left) Arabic support works with these buttons.

Add hover effect consistent with the rest of the app.

5. Backend & Data Handling

Update the Reports Controller / Route to accept an optional parameter (type).

Modify the Reports Service / Query to fetch only reports of the given type.

Example:

If type=training, fetch all training-related reports.

If type=veterinary, fetch all veterinary-related reports.

If no type parameter is given, show all reports (general default behavior).

6. Testing & Verification

Navigate to Training Section → Click Reports → Confirm Reports Section opens with only training reports.

Navigate to Veterinary Section → Click Reports → Confirm Reports Section opens with only veterinary reports.

Navigate to General Reports directly from menu → Confirm all reports are shown without filter.

Verify no regression: existing navigation and reports must remain functional.

Test Arabic RTL layouts to confirm button placement is correct.

7. Additional Notes

Write modular, well-documented code.

Add comments in routes and components explaining the new navigation logic.

Follow existing coding conventions and architecture.

Ensure no duplication of logic: use one shared handler for navigation if possible.

Reverse the table columns order in reports view for Arabic readability.

✅ Deliverables:

Updated Training Section (with “Reports” button)

Updated Veterinary Section (with “Reports” button)

Updated Reports Section (with filtering logic)

Fully tested navigation and report extraction per section
