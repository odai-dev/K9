ðŸ›‘ Problem Explanation
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going wrong:

When the GENERAL_ADMIN assigns a project and custom permissions to a PROJECT_MANAGER via the /admin dashboard, everything looks correct in the admin panel.

But when logging in as that PROJECT_MANAGER, the user sees nothing â€” no projects, no data, no sections, no functionality.

This means: the system is not enforcing or rendering the permissions saved by the admin when the Project Manager logs in.

In other words:

The permission assignments and project access are saved in the database, but theyâ€™re not being loaded or respected by the Project Managerâ€™s view.

âœ… What Needs to Be Fixed (Instructions)
1. Verify That Permissions Are Actually Saved
First, confirm that when the GENERAL_ADMIN edits a Project Managerâ€™s permissions, the changes are:

Being written to the database

Stored in the correct permissions table

Assigned with the correct user and project references

2. Ensure PM View Loads Only What He Is Allowed
When a PROJECT_MANAGER logs in, the system should:

Load their assigned projects

Filter dashboard sections and menu items based on the permissions given by the admin

Only allow access to actions they are authorized for (e.g., view dogs, upload medical records)

Right now, this loading step is either missing or not connected to the admin-assigned permissions.

3. Fix the Backend Logic for PM Login
After login, the system must:

Fetch the userâ€™s role

Retrieve their assigned permissions and projects

Inject only the allowed content into the UI (dogs, training, incidents, etc.)

Hide/disable anything theyâ€™re not allowed to access

4. Fix the Frontend Rendering
If the permissions and data are fetched correctly from the backend:

The frontend (e.g., sidebar menu, dashboard stats) should only show what this specific user has access to.

If nothing is shown, that means the frontend is either:

Not receiving the correct data

Or itâ€™s checking the wrong permission logic

5. Test This End-to-End
Create a new test user with the PROJECT_MANAGER role:

Assign them one project

Give them access to:

View dogs

Upload training reports

Log in as them

Confirm:

Only one project is visible

Only the authorized actions are visible

Unauthorized sections are fully hidden or blocked

ðŸ“Œ Summary
Right now, there is a disconnect between the permissions assigned in the Admin Dashboard and the Project Managerâ€™s experience after login. The system needs to be fixed so that:

The assigned permissions are checked on login

Only allowed content and actions are loaded for the Project Manager

The frontend reacts accordingly
