I want you to completely redesign and fix the "permissions management" screen for the General Admin, with the following exact behavior and structure.

This screen is the MAIN place where the General Admin controls access for users (Project Managers, Handlers, and any staff assigned to a specific project).

The flow must be like this:

1) First: Select the project
   - At the top of the permissions screen, the General Admin chooses a specific project from a dropdown or list.
   - After selecting the project, only the users assigned to this project should be shown (Project Managers, Handlers, and other employees for that project).

2) Second: Select the user (role is not enough, we select the exact account)
   - After the project is selected, the General Admin chooses a specific user account assigned to that project.
   - This can be a Project Manager, Handler, or any other employee in that project.

3) Third: Show a FULL permissions matrix for that user
   - After selecting the user, the system must display a complete list of ALL SCREENS in the entire system. I mean literally ALL screens, without exceptions.
   - This list must include:
     - All screens for Project Managers
     - All screens for Handlers
     - All screens for Admin
     - All reports, dashboards, schedules, incidents, approvals, settings, etc.
   - Nothing should be hidden. If there is a screen in the system, it must appear in this list.

4) For EACH screen, show detailed actions as ON/OFF toggles
   - For every screen in the list, show a row with that screen name.
   - For that screen, show separate permission toggles like:
     - View (open/see this screen)
     - Add / Create
     - Edit / Update
     - Delete / Remove
     - Approve / Reject (where this makes sense, e.g. approvals screens)
   - Each of these actions must be an ON/OFF switch (or checkbox).
   - The General Admin can turn each action ON or OFF for that specific user on that specific screen.

5) Behavior required:
   - If "View" is OFF for a screen:
     - The user must not see the menu item or button for that screen.
     - If they try to access it by direct URL, they must get a permission error.
   - If "Add" is OFF:
     - The "Add" / "New" buttons for that screen must be hidden and blocked.
   - If "Edit" is OFF:
     - Edit buttons or links must be hidden and blocked.
   - If "Delete" is OFF:
     - Delete buttons or actions must be hidden and blocked.
   - If "Approve" is OFF:
     - The user must not see or use any approval / reject buttons on that screen.

6) Completeness:
   - Right now, some screens like "incidents" and "approvals" are not visible at all in the permissions UI for the General Admin.
   - You must fix this so that:
     - Every single screen and important operation used by Project Managers and Handlers appears in the permissions matrix.
     - The General Admin can control every one of them with ON/OFF toggles.

7) Apply changes correctly:
   - When the General Admin changes these toggles and clicks "Save":
     - All changes must be saved without partial failures.
     - The next time the selected user logs in, their interface must immediately reflect the new permissions:
       - Only allowed screens must appear.
       - Forbidden screens must be hidden and blocked.
       - No more cases where I enable a screen but the user still sees "you are not allowed to access this page".

Please:
- Implement this full, per-project, per-user permissions matrix.
- Make sure it lists ALL screens and actions.
- Make sure ON/OFF toggles truly control what the user can and cannot see or do.
- Then test the full flow:
  - Select a project
  - Select a Project Manager
  - Turn ON/OFF some screens and actions
  - Log in as that Project Manager
  - Confirm the behavior is exactly as configured.
