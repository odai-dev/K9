There is a serious and still unresolved problem in the permissions system related to:

- Project Managers
- Handlers (sais)
- The admin “permissions” screen

I will explain the problem in a clear scenario so you can understand and fix it completely.

I am the General Admin.

When I open the permissions management screen to give permissions to a Project Manager or a Handler, I only see a small set of options. These options are NOT complete and do NOT cover all screens and actions they actually use in the system.

What I need as a General Admin is very simple and very clear:

1) I want to see ALL screens and ALL actions for:
   - Project Manager role
   - Handler role

2) For each screen, I want to be able to allow or deny:
   - View / open the screen
   - Create / Add
   - Edit
   - Delete
   - Approve / Reject (where applicable)

3) These permissions must appear as ON/OFF switches (or similar) in the permissions UI, so I can control exactly what each user can and cannot do.

Right now, this is NOT happening.

Here is the real problem in behavior:

- I logged in as General Admin.
- I opened the permissions management for a specific Project Manager.
- I gave this Project Manager permission to access certain pages (for example: incident logging, approvals).
- I saved the permissions successfully.
- Then I logged out and logged in as that Project Manager.
- When I click on the "incident" button to log an incident, I get a message that I am not allowed to access this page.
- When I click on the approvals screen, I also get that I am not allowed to access it.
- Some of these screens (like approvals) do not even appear in the permissions UI for me to turn them ON or OFF. So I cannot control them at all.

This means two things are wrong:

1) The permissions management UI is incomplete:
   - It does NOT list all screens and actions that belong to Project Managers and Handlers.
   - Some important screens (like incident reporting, approvals, etc.) are completely missing from the permissions list.

2) The permissions that I turn ON for a user are not being fully applied:
   - Even after I enable a permission and save changes as General Admin,
     the user (Project Manager or Handler) still cannot open that screen
     and sees a "not allowed to access this page" message.

I want you to:

- Make the permissions management screen truly COMPLETE for Project Managers and Handlers.
- Every screen and every important action they can do in the system must appear there with a clear label.
- I must be able to turn ON/OFF access to:
  - Incident logging screen
  - Approvals screen
  - Any other PM or Handler screen (dashboards, reports, schedules, etc.)
- After I enable a permission and save it, the user must actually be able to access that screen in their interface. No more “not allowed” errors when the permission is ON.

Please:

- Review all Project Manager and Handler screens and operations.
- Make sure they are all represented in the permissions UI for the General Admin.
- Make sure that when I turn a permission ON and save it, it is applied correctly and the user can access that screen.
- Fix any missing links between the permissions and the actual screens.

At the end, give me a short summary of:
- Which screens and actions you added to the permissions UI,
- And how you ensured that the permissions now actually work end-to-end for Project Managers and Handlers.
