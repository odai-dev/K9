Current System:
Handlers submit one type of report with all sections (Health, Training, Care, Behavior, Incidents)
No restrictions - handlers can create multiple reports on the same day
If a handler works multiple shifts or with multiple dogs, it's unclear how to handle reporting
The Problem You Identified:
Handlers may work:

Multiple shifts in one day
Different dogs in different shifts
Need to report quickly during/after each shift
Need comprehensive daily summary per dog at end of day
Proposed Changes: Two-Tier Reporting System
1. Shift Reports (NEW - Quick & Lightweight)
Purpose: Quick reporting during or right after each shift

Content: Only 3 sections:

✅ Health Section (11 body part checks)
✅ Behavior Section (good/bad behavior notes)
✅ Incidents Section (suspicion/detection cases with photos)
When: Created for each shift worked

Linked to the schedule item (your work assignment for that shift)
Example: Morning shift with Dog Rex → Create shift report for Rex
2. Daily Reports (EXISTING - Enhanced)
Purpose: Comprehensive end-of-day report per dog

Content: ALL 6 sections:

✅ Health Section
✅ Training Section (6 types of training)
✅ Care Section (feeding, grooming, excretion)
✅ Behavior Section
✅ Incidents Section
✅ Attachments
When: Created at end of day

One daily report per unique dog you worked with that day
New validation: Cannot create duplicate daily reports for same dog on same day
Can pull information from shift reports to help fill it out
Example Workflow:
Handler Ahmed on November 3rd:

Morning Shift (8am-12pm) - Dog Rex:

Works morning shift
Creates Shift Report #1: Quick health check, behavior notes for Rex
Submits it
Afternoon Shift (2pm-6pm) - Dog Max:

Works afternoon shift with different dog
Creates Shift Report #2: Quick health check, behavior notes for Max
Submits it
End of Day (6pm):

Creates Daily Report for Rex: Full report including training, care, behavior, incidents from the whole day
Creates Daily Report for Max: Full report including training, care, behavior, incidents from the whole day
Both daily reports can reference the earlier shift reports
Key Features to Add:
New database tables for ShiftReport (lightweight version)
Validation - prevent duplicate daily reports for same dog/day
Quick shift report button on handler dashboard
Smart daily report creation - shows all dogs worked with that day
Visual indicators - which dogs still need daily reports
Pre-population - daily reports can pull data from shift reports
