There is a major problem in the new permissions system.  
The General Admin cannot see all screens and operations inside the permissions management screen, even though these screens exist in the system and appear in the Admin interface.

For example:
I enabled the permission for a Project Manager to “Create Incident”, but when I logged in as that Project Manager, the interface only showed “View Incident” and the button for “Add Incident” or “Suspected Incident” never appeared.  
This means many screens and actions are still missing from the permissions matrix.

Here is what you MUST fix:

1) The permissions management screen must include ALL screens and ALL actions that exist anywhere in the entire system.  
   Not some of them — ALL of them.  
   If a screen or a button exists for the Admin, it MUST appear in the permissions UI so the Admin can enable or disable it.

2) For every screen in the system, you must list all actions separately:
   - View / Open
   - Add / Create
   - Edit / Update
   - Delete / Remove
   - Approve / Reject (where applicable)

3) The General Admin must be able to turn ON/OFF each action independently for each user.

4) When the Admin turns ON a permission:
   - The corresponding button or screen MUST appear immediately in the user’s dashboard.  
   - Example: If “Create Incident” is ON → the “Add Incident” button must appear in the PM dashboard and must open the create page.  
   - If “View Approvals” is ON → the user must see the approvals screen.  
   - If “Suspected Incident” is ON → its button must appear.

5) Any screen or route that exists in the system but is NOT added to the permissions UI is a bug.  
   You must scan the entire system (routes, templates, buttons) and add every missing screen and every missing action into the permissions matrix.

6) After implementing this:
   - Test enabling and disabling multiple permissions,
   - Log in as the user,
   - Ensure the correct buttons and screens appear or disappear exactly as configured.

Fix this completely and give me a summary of what was added and corrected.
