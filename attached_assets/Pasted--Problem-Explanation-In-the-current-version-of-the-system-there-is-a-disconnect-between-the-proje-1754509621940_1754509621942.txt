🛑 Problem Explanation
In the current version of the system, there is a disconnect between the project data and the admin panel (/admin).

Projects exist in the system and are correctly listed in the Projects section.

Each project has a Project Manager assigned (this is visible and functioning elsewhere).

However, when visiting the Admin Dashboard, the assigned projects for each PROJECT_MANAGER do not appear.

As a result, the GENERAL_ADMIN cannot see which Project Manager is linked to which project, and this prevents proper permission assignment or monitoring from the admin side.

This means:

There is either a missing link in the backend logic that fetches data for the admin panel,

Or the UI in /admin is not prepared to receive and display assigned projects — even though the data exists.

✅ What Needs to Be Done
1. Check the Data Model
Confirm that each project has a clear field (like project_manager_id) or an assignment table linking it to one or more Project Managers.

Ensure that the relationship between users and projects is correctly defined in the backend.

2. Update the Backend Logic for /admin
When generating the data for the Admin Dashboard, make sure the backend is also retrieving the projects assigned to each Project Manager.

Each manager should have a list of their assigned projects included in the admin data response.

3. Update the Admin UI
In the admin dashboard interface, for every listed Project Manager, display a list of their assigned projects.

This should be easy to scan, even for multiple managers.

4. Test the Integration
After implementing the above steps:

Visit the Projects section and confirm that a Project Manager is assigned.

Then go to the Admin Dashboard and verify that those projects are now visible under the corresponding manager.

📝 Summary
The system currently has a gap between where project assignments are stored and where they are displayed. Your task is to bridge this gap by ensuring the Admin Dashboard reflects the live assignments already present in the Projects module — both in data and in the user interface.
