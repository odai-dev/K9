## Overview
The Project Manager (PM) dashboard has been completely redesigned with a dedicated navigation system and enhanced user interface optimized for the PM role scope.

  - الكلاب (Dogs) - Manage project dogs
  - الفريق (Team) - Team member management
  - الموافقات (Approvals) - Review pending items with badge counter
  
- **Real-time Badge Counter**: Shows pending approval count on the navbar

  - `my_dogs.html`
  - `project_view.html`

  - Warning (Yellow) for Pending Approvals
  - Success (Green) for Active status
  - Danger (Red) for Veterinary visits
