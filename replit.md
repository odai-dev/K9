# K9 Operations Management System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive, web-based, and mobile-first K9 operations management system designed for military and police canine units, featuring Arabic RTL compatibility. Its core purpose is to manage the entire lifecycle of K9s, including employee supervision, project management, training, veterinary care, breeding, and operational missions. The system aims to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and provide robust tracking and reporting for critical canine unit functions, supporting optimized K9 deployment and resource utilization.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 RTL for comprehensive UI components with right-to-left language support.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS optimized for RTL layouts.
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts, specifically Noto Sans Arabic, for appropriate Arabic text rendering.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design approach ensuring full responsiveness across all device types.

### Technical Implementations
- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python) utilizing a modular Blueprint structure.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, integrated via SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login implements session-based authentication and role-based access control with two tiers: `GENERAL_ADMIN` (full access) and `PROJECT_MANAGER` (limited to assigned resources).
- **Database Migrations**: Flask-Migrate, powered by Alembic, for schema versioning and management.
- **File Handling**: Local file system storage for uploads, with configurable limits.
- **Security**: Incorporates CSRF protection, configurable session timeouts, input validation, and audit logging for all user actions, including IP tracking.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dogs Management**: Tracks full lifecycle (Active, Retired, Deceased, Training), physical characteristics, photos, and assignments.
- **Employee Management**: Manages personal and professional information for roles (Handler, Vet, Project Manager), including assignment and attendance.
- **Training System**: Records session-based training across various categories (Obedience, Detection, Agility, Attack, Fitness) with trainer assignments and progress notes.
- **Veterinary Care**: Documents visits (Routine, Emergency, Vaccination), health metrics, diagnoses, treatments, and costs.
- **Production Management**: Covers general information, maturity tracking, heat cycles, mating records, pregnancy monitoring, delivery records, puppy management, and puppy training.
- **Project Operations**: Manages project lifecycle (Planned, Active, Completed, Cancelled), resource allocation (dogs), incident logging, suspicion reporting, and performance evaluations. Project managers are restricted to one active or planned project at a time.
- **Attendance System**: Comprehensive attendance tracking with shift management, employee and dog scheduling, and project-specific attendance recording. Includes dual group attendance tracking, leave management, and reporting with Arabic RTL PDF export.
- **Unified Matrix Attendance System**: Advanced attendance matrix feature displaying employees vs dates with comprehensive filtering, pagination, real-time data loading, and multi-format export capabilities.
- **Ultra-Granular Permission System**: Revolutionary permission architecture providing GENERAL_ADMIN users with complete control over PROJECT_MANAGER access at a subsection level. Features 79 distinct permission combinations across 9 major sections with 7 action types each, comprehensive audit logging, and an intuitive admin dashboard.

### System Design Choices
- **Client/Server Separation**: Clear distinction between frontend and backend.
- **Data Integrity**: Uses Enum-based status management for consistency.
- **Secure Identification**: UUID fields for object identification.
- **Flexible Data Storage**: JSON fields for metadata and audit logs.
- **Performance**: Optimized with database connection pooling and file size limits.
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture and role-based data isolation for future expansion.

## External Dependencies
